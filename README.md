# ElectricRail

A cross-platform core runtime for message response robots(QQ, WeChat, Twitter, etc.). 

## The do's and don'ts 

The ElectricRail aims at the response logic and module management. It ONLY provides the basic logic of how to write a response module, and how to manage your modules.It wouldn't tell you how to implement the methods to adapt to the robot APIs. On the contrary, you needn't to know the message source and the destination, even the message present ways!

Meanwhile, It also provides some common interfaces so that you can quickly start your robot via exist platforms or sources, such as web page, console, CoolQ plugin (for QQ) ,WeChat open API, etc.

## How to use

The ElectricRail runtime is now developing! We hope you can join this project and give your ideas.
